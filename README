TextBrush is an innovative and dynamic text drawing tool that allows users to create artistic and customized text compositions on a canvas.
The project leverages the power of Kotlin and Android to provide a user-friendly interface for drawing, designing, and interacting with text in creative ways.

Key Features:

Text Drawing: Users can draw text on the canvas by simply tapping on the screen. The text is added in a visually appealing and interactive manner.

Customization: TextBrush offers a range of customization options. Users can dynamically change the font size, adjust the spacing between letters,
and even modify the rotation angle of the text. This flexibility empowers users to create unique and expressive text compositions.

Undo Functionality: Mistakes can happen, but TextBrush provides an undo button to erase the last drawn segment. This feature ensures a seamless and
frustration-free user experience.

Image Integration: The canvas can also include images that fill the screen, making it an even more versatile platform for creative expression.

Text Movement: Users can interact with the drawn text, moving it around the canvas to find the perfect spot for their artistic creation.

TextBrush not only demonstrates the technical proficiency of working with Android and Kotlin but also highlights the importance of user experience
and visual design. It's an excellent tool for artists, designers, and anyone who wants to add a personal touch to their digital creations.
